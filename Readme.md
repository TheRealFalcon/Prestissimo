# Prestissimo

Prestissimo adds variable speed playback functionality to your audio applications.  It is a free drop-in replacement for the Presto Sound Library Open Beta.

You must use a podcatcher or audio player that supports Presto.  The podcatcher will provide the interface
to control playback speed.  

Currently works for BeyondPod on my Galaxy S3 running CM 10.1.  No other app/device combinations have been tested.
